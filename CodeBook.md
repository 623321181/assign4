The data only consists of mean value and standard diviation of the variable. It is grouped by activities and subjects.

I have renamed the columns by the features, and I changed names to make easier to understand.
I merged test and train data into a single data set, and removed varaibles other than mean or std.
I grouped the values by activities and subjects, and created a tidy summrised dataset of means.
